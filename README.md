# Translate books with GPT

This project harnesses the power of GPT-4 LLM to translate eBooks from any language into your preferred language, maintaining the integrity and structure of the original content. Imagine having access to a vast world of literature, regardless of the original language, right at your fingertips.

This tool not only translates the text but also carefully compiles each element of the eBook ‚Äì chapters, footnotes, and all ‚Äì into a perfectly formatted EPUB file. We use the `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` model by default to ensure high-quality translations.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To install the necessary components for our project, follow these simple steps:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

Remember to add your OpenAI key to `config.yaml`.


## üéÆ Usage

The application can be used in two modes: interactive CLI mode and command-line arguments mode.

### Interactive CLI Mode

Simply run the application without any arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
python main.py
```

The interactive mode will guide you through the process:
1. Choose between translating a book or viewing chapters
2. Enter the path to your EPUB file
3. Provide the configuration file path
4. Select source and target languages
5. Choose which chapters to translate

### Command-Line Arguments Mode

For automation or advanced usage, you can use command-line arguments:

#### Show Chapters

To review the structure of your book:

```bash
python main.py show-chapters --input yourbook.epub
```

#### Translate Mode

Basic usage:

```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --config config.yaml --from-lang EN --to-lang PL
```

Advanced usage (translating specific chapters):

```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --config config.yaml --from-chapter 13 --to-chapter 37 --from-lang EN --to-lang PL
```


## Converting from AZW3 to EPUB

For books in AZW3 format (Amazon Kindle), use Calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com) to convert them to EPUB before using this tool.


## DRM (Digital Rights Management)

Amazon eBooks (AZW3 format) are encrypted with your device's serial number. To decrypt these books, use the DeDRM tool (https://dedrm.com). You can find your Kindle's serial number at https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices.


## ü§ù Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions to this project! Your insights and improvements are invaluable. Currently, we're particularly interested in contributions in the following areas:

- Support for other eBook formats: AZW3, MOBI, PDF
- Integration of a built-in DeDRM tool
- Additional language support
- UI/UX improvements for the interactive mode

Join us in breaking down language barriers in literature and enhancing the accessibility of eBooks worldwide!
